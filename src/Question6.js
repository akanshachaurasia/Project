recommended options for third-party integrations for Monitoring or Logging.
Knowing that:
a. Vercel has in-house observability products,
b. Vercel likes to guide on processes, but
c. Vercel doesnâ€™t like to steer customers towards one solution or another, but
demonstrates what the product can do.
How would you respond to the customer?

Hello [Customer name],
Thank you for reaching us. 
Regarding the question of how to redirect the /blog URL to another website. Vercel supports Redirects, which allow you to set HTTP redirects in the application configuration regardless of the framework used. Redirects are handled at the Edge for all regions. 
Links for reference:

I hope the information provided is what you were looking for. 
Please feel free to contact us if any additional support is required from our end. 
Best Regards,

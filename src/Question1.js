How did you determine your solution was successful?

During the early stages of the Digital/Scalable CSM process, managing several accounts for a team of two digital CSMs was difficult due to the need to interact and manage with internal/external stakeholders. 
As a result, I suggested to the top leaders that we should construct a digital pool method, which many organizations and the Assisted CSM team of Informatica are using at present and has proven successful. Following several conversations, the team created a procedure to be followed for a pool process that will reduce the time consumption and increase workplace productivity.
